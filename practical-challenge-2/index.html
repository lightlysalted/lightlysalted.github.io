            <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
                <p>Sir Chloe performed in <strong>Phoenix, AZ</strong> on August 2023, opening for artists Beck and Phoenix.</p>
                <p>According to lead singer Dana Foote, the reason behind the name "Sir Chloe" is because her mother almost named her Chloe, and she was always partial to the name. The prefix "sir" provides an element of androgyny and elegance.</p>
                <p>They have a song called "Sedona."</p>
